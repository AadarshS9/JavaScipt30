# JavaScript 30 Days Challenge

This repository contains my solutions to the JavaScript 30 Days Challenge offered by Wes Bos. 

## About the Challenge

The JavaScript 30 Days Challenge is a free JavaScript course by Wes Bos where you build 30 projects in 30 days. Each project focuses on different aspects of JavaScript, including ES6 syntax, DOM manipulation, CSS tricks, and more. It's a great way to improve your JavaScript skills and build practical projects along the way.

## Repository Structure

Each day's challenge has its own folder within this repository. Inside each folder, you'll find my solution to the challenge. Additionally, I've included any modifications or extra features I implemented beyond the basic requirements.
