# JavaScript 30 Days Challenge

This repository contains my solutions to the JavaScript 30 Days Challenge offered by Wes Bos. 

## About the Challenge

The JavaScript 30 Days Challenge is a free JavaScript course by Wes Bos where you build 30 projects in 30 days. 
<br>Each project focuses on different aspects of JavaScript, including ES6 syntax, DOM manipulation, CSS tricks, and more. 
<br>It's a great way to improve your JavaScript skills and build practical projects along the way.

## Repository Structure

Each day's challenge has its own folder within this repository. 
<br>Inside each folder, you'll find my solution to the challenge. 
<br>Additionally, I've included any modifications or extra features I implemented beyond the basic requirements.
